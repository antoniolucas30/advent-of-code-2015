### What is Advent of Code?

Advent of code is a series of programming challenges created by Eric Wastl. These challenges consist on various problem that provoke the programmer to solve them by providing just one input and requiring the correct output, with no needing of submitting your code to a judge.

### But why did I try to solve some of the problems?

After seeing the incredible concept behind this event, I got excited to try to solve some of them by starting with the first edition, made in 2015. So I decided to invite some incredible friends of mine to discuss the problems, learn concepts of programming and, more importantly, have lots of fun with my friends and with the challenges :D!

In addition, is important to say that my solutions weren't the best ones, even the best ones that I could make. But I tried to solve some of them without caring that much to some aspects of the code like the beauty of it or low runtimes, what may have caused, for my codes, poor solutions.

### So, how do I utilize your answer?

For each Day of the 2015 edition, I provided the two parts needed to achieve two gold stars, the input provided for me and correspondent outputs for each part.

To verify my solutions, you could run (consider I am using PopOS 20.04):

* **C solutions:**
-> Compiled with gcc -std=c99 partX.c -o partX -Wall -Wextra
-> Run with ./partX < Input.txt > OutputPartX.txt

* **Python Solutions:**
-> Run with python3 partX.py < Input.txt > Output.txt
